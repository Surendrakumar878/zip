            In an economy that gives consumers more choice and transparency than
            ever before, providing an optimised user experience (UX) is critical
            for the success of organisations. That means ensuring every touch
            point between your brand and the user should be a positive one that
            encourages them to take the action you want – increasing conversions
            and boosting sales. The UX team at Impress!ve™ specialises in
            designing and building a seamless user journey, making sure the user
            experience is as good as it can be at every single stage. Taking
            your audience from someone that’s unfamiliar with your brand and
            turning them into a valuable customer, we curate an environment that
            drives traffic, sales and retention, for lower CPCs and to maximise
            the value of each visitor.

          The formation of the logo was crafted using various mathematical
          formulas where inspiration was taken from the chess board having 64
          square arranged in 8x8 grid in a flat square shape. The 64 checkered
          squares where then crafted into 3 dimensional cubical box format which
          later on its was crafted into spherical formation of the 64 checkered
          boxes. All this was done to achieve a Round shaped 64 checkered boxes
          perfectly into the same formation as we see this in flat chess board.
          Flat cubical was divided into 8 parts a multiplication of 64 to get
          perfect formation of C in cubical flat shape.
